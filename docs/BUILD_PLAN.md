# Kliff & Chao — Production Build Plan (v2, merged)

This replaces the earlier `BUILD_PLAN.md`. It merges two documents:

- **`PLAN.md`** is the spec for **design, frontend and the password gate**. `prototype/index.html` is the spec for look-and-feel; `docs/design/website2.0.pdf` (glass) is the current client direction behind it.
- **This file** is the spec for **architecture**: Supabase Postgres as the source of truth, Prisma, admin, Sheets sync, launch.

**Precedence rule.** Where the two disagree, the prototype wins on visuals, `PLAN.md` wins on the gate, and this file wins on data, RSVP, admin and sync. Every `PLAN.md` section about the Sheets append-only log, `RSVP_Current` as source of truth, Sheets read caching, and `lib/sheets/guests.ts` is **superseded** here.

---

## Decisions locked

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Source of truth | **Supabase Postgres** via Prisma. Sheets is an input (guest list) and a mirror (RSVPs). |
| RSVP model | **Household.** One guest answers attending/not attending for each named member of their party, plus one message per party. No plus-one counts, no meal or contact fields. |
| Edits | **Allowed until `RSVP_DEADLINE`**, with the form prefilled from current answers. Read-only after the deadline, enforced server-side (409). |
| Finding yourself | **Shared password + server-side name search** (per `PLAN.md`). No invitation codes. |
| Guest auth | Shared password → `jose` JWT cookie (per `PLAN.md`). |
| Admin auth | Supabase Auth, admin-only. |
| Region | Vercel `sin1` + Supabase **Southeast Asia (Singapore)**. Both must match. |
| Animation | GSAP + ScrollTrigger + Lenis only. No Framer Motion. |
| Visual language | Glass (per `website2.0.pdf`), journey is a coverflow, top chrome is three separate objects. Details in `PLAN.md`. |
| UI kit | shadcn/ui for the RSVP form and admin only. The story panels are custom, ported from the prototype. |

**Dropped from the earlier plan:** `invitationCode`, `maxGuests`, `numberAttending`, `guestNames`, the "already RSVP'd, blocked" screen, `ThemeToggle`, and porting the *old* single-file site.

## Stack

Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript · Tailwind CSS v4 · shadcn/ui · Prisma · Supabase Postgres · Supabase Auth (admin) · Zod · React Hook Form · `jose` · `node:crypto` scrypt · GSAP/ScrollTrigger · Lenis · Leaflet + OSM · Resend · Vercel · Cloudflare DNS · `google-auth-library` (Sheets mirror only).

> ✅ **Versions verified in Phase 0, locked below.** Checked against current Next.js and Prisma docs:
>
> - **Next.js 16** (latest stable, 16.1.1+; use the latest 16.x patch — 16.2.11 fixes CVE-2026-64642, a middleware/proxy bypass under Turbopack + `i18n.locales`; we don't use `i18n` but pin the patched version anyway). `middleware.ts` is deprecated in favour of `proxy.ts` (same file, renamed export, default export or `export const proxy`), and it now runs on the **Node.js runtime by default** instead of Edge. This doesn't change the gate design — `jose` was chosen so session verification works on either runtime — but every `middleware.ts` reference below means `proxy.ts`.
> - **Prisma ORM 7** (latest stable, 7.6.0+). Breaking changes that affect this plan: a **driver adapter is now mandatory** for Postgres (`@prisma/adapter-pg`, not optional as in v6), the datasource URL moves out of `schema.prisma` into a new **`prisma.config.ts`** at the repo root, the package needs `"type": "module"` in `package.json`, and `prisma migrate dev`/`db push` no longer auto-run `generate`. See "Connections on Vercel" below for what this means for the pooled/direct URL split.

## Reusability split

| Location | Contains | Reusable? |
|---|---|---|
| `config/site.ts` | Couple names, date, venue, deadline display, external links, feature flags | Swap per project |
| `content/` | All copy: chapters and stories, verses, wedding details, motif, entourage, FAQ | Swap per project |
| `components/site/` | The ported prototype design | Swap per project |
| `components/rsvp/`, `components/ui/` | RSVP flow, shadcn | Mostly generic |
| `lib/`, `app/api/`, `app/admin/`, `prisma/` | Gate, DB, search, RSVP, sync, admin | Generic |

## Repo layout

This is the single source for folder structure; `PLAN.md` points here. Keep it that way: two trees drift.

Rules that go with it:

- **`prototype/` is excluded** from `tsconfig.json`, ESLint and Prettier, so its single-file code doesn't fail the checks.
- **`.gitignore`** covers `.env*` (except `.env.example`), `prototype/video/intro2.mp4` (the 2 GB source, per `PLAN.md`), and any raw exports.
- **Don't port `prototype/index-timeline.html`.** It's the rejected linear variant; delete it or leave it out of the repo.
- Unit tests sit next to the file they test (`match.ts` → `match.test.ts`); database tests go in `tests/db/`.

`lib/track/` holds the scroll maths from `PLAN.md` ("One pinned ScrollTrigger", the coverflow `paintFlow` numbers) as pure functions, so the components just apply the results and the maths gets unit tests.

  @@unique([submissionId, guestId])            // no duplicate guest within one submit

// Current state: exactly one row per guest (the DB-level dedupe rule)
model GuestRsvp {
  guestId            String           @id
  guest              Guest            @relation(fields: [guestId], references: [id])
  status             AttendanceStatus
  respondedAt        DateTime
  respondedByGuestId String
  lastSubmissionId   String
}
```

Why two layers: `RsvpSubmission`/`RsvpResponse` keep the full edit history with attribution (the recoverability `PLAN.md` got from its append-only log), and `GuestRsvp` gives one authoritative current answer per guest. Both are written in **one transaction**, so concurrent submits from the same household can't leave them inconsistent. The party message shown in the form is the `message` of the party's most recent submission.

### Supabase security — do this in the first migration

Supabase exposes the `public` schema through its Data API, and the anon key ships to the browser (needed for admin login). **With RLS off, anyone could read the guest list with that key.** Pick one:

- **Enable RLS on every table with no policies** (Prisma connects as the table owner and bypasses RLS; the Data API gets nothing), or
- Put the Prisma tables in a dedicated schema that is not exposed to the Data API.

Add a check to Phase 1's "done when": a request to the Supabase REST endpoint for `Guest` with the anon key returns nothing.

### Connections on Vercel

`DATABASE_URL` = Supabase **pooled** connection (transaction mode) for the app; `DIRECT_URL` = direct connection for migrations. With Prisma 7, both are read in `prisma.config.ts` (not `schema.prisma`) and handed to `@prisma/adapter-pg` — the app instantiates the adapter with `DATABASE_URL`, and the CLI's `migrate`/`db push` commands use `DIRECT_URL` via the same config file's `migrate.url` (or an env override), since Supabase's pooler doesn't support the advisory locks migrations need.

---

## Guest search

Server-side only, as `PLAN.md` requires — never ship the guest list to the client.

Enable the `pg_trgm` and `fuzzystrmatch` extensions in a migration. Search via `$queryRaw` (Prisma can't express these functions) across first name, last name, both name orders and nickname, excluding archived guests. Apply `PLAN.md`'s scoring ladder in SQL: exact 100 → prefix 90 → substring 70 → trigram similarity 65 → `dmetaphone` match 55, threshold 50, top 8.

At ~200 guests a full scan is fine; add a GIN trigram index only if `EXPLAIN` says you need it.

Return `{ id, displayName }` only. Client: debounce 150ms, `AbortController` per keystroke, min 2 chars.

> Test against the real misspellings list before calling this done: `Co`/`Kho`, `Chow`/`Chao`, `See`/`Sy`, `Wy`/`Uy`, `Dee`/`Dy`, `Ong`/`Ang`, plus nicknames. If Postgres `dmetaphone` misses any that the JS `double-metaphone` catches, precompute codes in JS at sync time into a `phoneticCodes String[]` column instead.

---

## RSVP flow

### `GET /api/party?guestId=`

`requireGate()` → load guest (not archived) → return `Party`: members with current `GuestRsvp` state, latest message, `hasSubmission`, `lastRespondedAt`, `editable` (server clock vs `RSVP_DEADLINE`), `deadlineIso`. No `GET /api/parties/:id` — enumeration risk.

### `POST /api/rsvp`

Payload (no `partyId` — the server derives it):

```ts
{
  submittedByGuestId: string;
  responses: { guestId: string; status: 'ATTENDING' | 'NOT_ATTENDING' }[];
  message?: string;              // ≤500
  clientSubmissionId: string;    // uuid per form mount
}
```

Order of checks: `requireGate()` → rate limit (optional) → zod parse → deadline (409) → resolve submitter's party → **reject any `guestId` outside that party (403 `outside_party`)** → reject duplicate guest ids (400) → transaction:

1. Insert `RsvpSubmission` with `id = clientSubmissionId`. On unique violation (Prisma `P2002`) → return `200 { deduped: true, party }`, write nothing else.
2. Insert the `RsvpResponse` rows.
3. Upsert `GuestRsvp` for each responded guest.

After commit, fire-and-forget: **Resend** email to the couple and **Sheets mirror** append. Return the fresh `Party`.

### UI behaviour (from `PLAN.md`)

- Banner when already answered: "We've got your RSVP from {date}. You can update it until {deadline}."
- Every control prefilled; CTA reads "Update our RSVP."
- Per-person attribution: "Answered by Maria on 3 March."
- Read-only after the deadline.
- After submit: **BACK TO HOME** returns to the intro panel.

> ⚠️ Known and accepted for now: anyone with the password who finds a name can change that household's RSVP. History makes every change recoverable. Per-party PINs are the fix if the couple asks.

---

## Google Sheets

Two directions, one service account.

**Sheet → DB (guest list).** The couple edits the `Guests` tab: `guest_id · first_name · last_name · nickname · party_id · party_label · side · notes_private`.

- An installable Apps Script trigger posts changed rows to `/api/sync` with `x-sync-secret`. The route upserts by `externalId`.
- `onEdit` does **not** fire on row deletion. Handle removals in the admin "Sync now" full pull: guests missing from the sheet get `archivedAt` set (never hard-deleted — their RSVP history must survive). An installable `onChange` trigger that calls the full pull is optional.
- Map columns by header name; reject with a specific error if a header is missing.
- 🔴 **Seed `guest_id` and `party_id` as pasted values, never live formulas.** Re-rolled ids orphan every RSVP. Bold this in the couple's instructions.

**DB → Sheet (RSVP mirror).** After each committed submission, append rows to `RSVP_Log` (`values.append`, `valueInputOption=RAW`, `insertDataOption=INSERT_ROWS`), with `PLAN.md`'s `safeCell` escape for CSV injection. Retry 429/5xx only, with backoff. If the mirror fails, log it; the DB is still correct and admin can rebuild the tab. `RSVP_Current` formulas are an optional convenience for the couple.

**GCP setup** follows `PLAN.md`: Sheets API only, service account with no IAM roles, share sheet as Editor, key as `GOOGLE_SA_KEY_B64`. Create it under a **personal Google account**, not a Workspace/work account.

## Phases

Each phase ends deployable to a **Vercel preview**. Keep the prototype live on its current URL until Phase 8.

### Phase 0 — Foundation
- New repo and new Vercel project. `create-next-app` (TS, App Router, Tailwind v4), shadcn/ui, `vercel.json` with `sin1`, `noindex` headers + `robots.txt`, `lib/env.ts`, ESLint + Prettier + Vitest with the npm scripts in `CLAUDE.md`, General Sans via `next/font/local` (Montserrat fallback). Lay out the repo as in "Repo layout" above: `CLAUDE.md` at the root, specs and PDFs in `docs/`, the prototype in `prototype/`. Security headers in `vercel.json` as `PLAN.md` specifies, including `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.
- **Done when:** a preview URL renders a placeholder, pushes auto-deploy, response headers show `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`, and `lint`, `typecheck` and `test` all run clean.
- **Prompt:** *"Read docs/BUILD_PLAN.md and docs/PLAN.md. We're on Phase 0. First check the current Next.js and Prisma docs and tell me whether anything in the 'Verify versions' note changes the plan — stop and wait for my answer before scaffolding."*

### Phase 1 — Data layer
- Supabase project in Singapore. Prisma init, the schema above, extensions migration (`pg_trgm`, `fuzzystrmatch`), RLS lockdown migration, `seed.ts` from a CSV of ~20 test guests in ~6 households, including the misspelling cases.
- **Done when:** Prisma Studio shows seeded parties and guests, and an anon-key request to Supabase's REST API for guests returns nothing.
- **Prompt:** *"Phase 1. Implement the data model, extensions and RLS lockdown from BUILD_PLAN.md, plus a seed script for prisma/seed-data.csv. Explain the pooled vs direct connection as you go."*

### Phase 2 — Gate backend
- `password.ts` → `session.ts` → `/api/gate` → middleware → `requireGate()` → gated layout, exactly per `PLAN.md` "Password gate". Plain unstyled form for now.
- **Done when:** `PLAN.md` Verification 1–3 pass **on a Vercel preview**, including the `x-middleware-subrequest` curl returning 401.
- **Prompt:** *"Phase 2. Build the gate backend per the Password gate section of PLAN.md. Unstyled form only. Then give me the exact curl commands for Verification 1–3."*

### Phase 3 — RSVP core
- `/api/guests/search`, `/api/party`, `/api/rsvp` with the transaction, idempotency and 403/409 rules. `GuestSearch` → `PartyForm` (React Hook Form + zod, shadcn), prefill, banner, attribution, confirmation. Resend mirror. Sheets mirror can be stubbed until Phase 6.
- **Done when:**
  - The misspelling list resolves correctly.
  - Picking a guest shows their whole household.
  - Submit → re-enter name → **answers prefilled**; edit → history has two submissions, `GuestRsvp` has one row per guest.
  - Foreign `guestId` → 403 `outside_party`.
  - Same `clientSubmissionId` twice → `{ deduped: true }`, one submission row.
  - 5 concurrent submits for one household → 5 submissions, coherent `GuestRsvp`.
  - Past `RSVP_DEADLINE` → read-only form, API 409.
- **Prompt:** *"Phase 3. Implement the RSVP flow in BUILD_PLAN.md. Search uses raw SQL; explain why Prisma can't express it. Write a small script that fires 5 concurrent submissions so I can run the concurrency check."*

### Phase 4 — Frontend port
- Port `prototype/index.html` into `components/site/`, **not** a rebuild from prose. All copy into `content/`, all tokens into `globals.css`/the Tailwind theme. Order:
  1. `HorizontalTrack` + `lib/track/` maths, with `history.scrollRestoration = 'manual'` set before ScrollTrigger measures anything.
  2. Gate UI + `AudioProvider` together (no `<form>` on the gate; birds and ambience).
  3. Glass primitives, the `-webkit-` prefix and the `@supports not` fallback, then the top bar: bare wordmark, section pill with the capsule indicator, separate RSVP pill, audio disc.
  4. Intro + verse (verse bottom-right).
  5. Journey coverflow: chapter stepper, desktop driver, mobile scroll-snap, then drag/wheel gestures through the same `jumpTo()`.
  6. Wedding tabs: details and countdown, day timeline, motif groups (`<details>`), entourage (plain text), FAQ.
  7. RSVP overlay styling and the three chaodesign credits.
- Decide the mobile intro-video option before starting the intro panel.
- **Done when:** `PLAN.md` Verification 4–6 and 13–29 pass, including the **real iPhone** checks for audio and glass.
- **Prompt:** *"Phase 4, step 1. Port the prototype's HorizontalTrack, following docs/PLAN.md. Put the scroll maths in lib/track/ as pure functions with unit tests. Don't add any animation library besides GSAP. Show me how the single onUpdate feeds the coverflow, the chapter stepper and the top-bar capsule."*

### Phase 5 — Admin dashboard
- Supabase Auth login, `/admin` guarded by `require-admin` (session **and** email in `ADMIN_EMAILS`). Counts: invited, households, attending, not attending, pending. Guest table with status and "answered by". Per-household history view.
- **Done when:** a logged-out user and a logged-in non-allowlisted user both get nothing from `/admin` and its data routes.

### Phase 6 — Sheets sync
- Apps Script webhook → `/api/sync` upsert; "Sync now" full pull with archiving; RSVP mirror to `RSVP_Log`.
- **Done when:** editing a row in `Guests` updates the DB within seconds; deleting a row then "Sync now" archives the guest and keeps their history; a submission appears in `RSVP_Log`.

### Phase 7 — Hardening
- Error and empty states: DB unreachable, search no-results, offline submit. Optional Upstash rate limits with `PLAN.md`'s generous tiers; Turnstile on the gate only if abuse appears.
- **Done when:** killing `DATABASE_URL` on a preview shows a friendly error screen, not a stack trace.

### Phase 8 — Launch
- Domain on Cloudflare → Vercel, HTTPS. Real password hash, secrets rotated from dev values. Re-run the full Verification list on production. Then point guests at the new site.
- **Done when:** production passes every check and the prototype URL redirects or is retired.

## Open items before or during the build

- **Next.js and Prisma versions** — resolve in Phase 0.
- **RSVP deadline** — needed for Phase 3.
- **Mobile intro video** (poster-only recommended) — needed for Phase 4.
